# 📦 Creating Storage Bucket - Step by Step

## ⚠️ The bucket doesn't exist! Let's create it:

---

## Go to this page:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ewfrofdnvqdcvfffzpdw/storage/buckets

---

## Steps:

### 1. Click "New bucket" button
   - It's a green button in the top right corner

### 2. Fill in the form:
   ```
   Name: comparisons
   ```
   ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The name must be EXACTLY `comparisons` (lowercase, no spaces)

### 3. Enable Public Access
   ✅ **CHECK** the box that says "Public bucket"
   
   This is CRITICAL - without this, uploads will fail!

### 4. Click "Create bucket"

---

## ✅ Verify it was created:

After clicking create, you should see:
- A bucket named "comparisons" in the list
- It should have a small "public" badge/icon

---

## 🧪 Then test again:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Upload Before and After images
3. Click "Create Comparison"

---

**Tell me when you've created it!** 😊
